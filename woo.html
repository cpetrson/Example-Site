        <h1>Supporting Micro Business with a Website</h1>
        <p>March - August, 2024</p>
        <p class="text-left">Branching out into the eCommerce side of WordPress meant working with a plugin that would support sales, products, and customers.  A little research yielded WooCommerce as one of the frontrunners in this space, so after purchasing a managed WordPress account with a2hosting.com (I didn't want to do my own WP support), I installed the plugin and began.  Here's a bird's eye view of my experience:</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 mb-4 mb-md-0">
          <img style="border:2px solid black;" src="images/IMG_0893.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="A website." />
          <p class="mt-1 small">This is the WordPress/WooCommerce website hosted on a2hosting.com.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4 mb-4 mb-md-0">
          <img src="images/IMG_8435.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Making product." />
          <p class="mt-1 small">Creating product is a significant process in itself.</p>

          <img src="images/IMG_8601.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Market." />

        <h1>Advantages:</h1>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Sales!</li>
                <li>The ability to accept credit card payments through the website -- from anywhere.</li>
                <li>A better business card: the live ecommerce website promoted a professional look.</li>
                <li>Better product listing and showcasing.</li>
                <li>A digital 'home' for the micro business.</li>
                <li>The WooCommerce app for Samsung/iPhone - my favorite aspect.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h1>Disadvantages:</h1> 
            <p><ul>
                <li>Per-charge fee.</li>
                <li>WooCommerce Point-of-Sale device - I never got this up and running, but the website provided a way for customers to pay with their phones.</li>
                <li>Receipt printer - this was another device I purchased but did not get running by the end of the season.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>The Experience:</h2>
        <p>Using WooCommerce for live sales meant that I needed a product line to sell.  Grabbing a hobby (felted wool) and spinning up a business plan, I launched the website using a2hosting.com's 'Managed WordPress' offering. I added the plugin, took a zillion photos, populated the products, and sold my first product to myself! Wow! While it was great to see the payment come through to my bank account, the cost of getting that payment was the irony!! However, the site was an easy way for customers to pay, and it turned out to be the favorite payment method for local pickup, so it was the right approach.  Additionally, the WooCommerce app for Samsung/iphone was a favorite aspect - I could manage products and even prices while at the farmers' market.</p>
        <p>The whole project was a great learning experience and I enjoyed making the site, the products, and the connections with interested people at the farmers' market.  It was well worth the effort.</p>
