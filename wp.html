        <p>2019 - Present</p>
        <p class="text-left">After what seemed like tons of research into hosting options, developer-friendly hosting, and what various plans offered, I chose a2hosting.com - in part because they advertised their support for node.js and their developer-first approach.  Indeed, it did feel like I was sitting at my own computer and had as much control as I would have had there.  Their shared hosting 'Drive' plan was my choice.  I was actually stumped after installing WordPress by how to get back to my wp-config panel, but after their helpdesk got me back on track I was off and running.  Here are some highlights from this project:</p>

          <p class="mt-1 small">Site Login.</p>
          <p>One of the first websites I built was a WordPress child-theme site for a family reunion.  I learned to get around in WordPress, cPanel, and the themes folder.  I started by making a child theme to contain my modifications, but when I picked up Brad Schiff's tutorial (see below) and saw how much better his approach was to WordPress Theme Development, I scrapped the first attempt and rebuilt the site using his 'Fictional University' model site as a template.  Thanks Brad!</p>
